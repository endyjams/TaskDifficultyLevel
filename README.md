# TaskDifficultyLevel

- App created with Flutter Framework
- You can add tasks and rate them
- it has some types of tasks like: Reading and Ride a Bike
- Then, you have a "Adding difficulty" feature, so you can manage how difficulty the task is
- Each task will have a progress bar, and as it get to the end, you'll get a star on the task
- The number of stars on a task will show how difficult the task is
